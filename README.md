## About Me

My name is Michael Dessureault, 

I am a graduate from Sheridan College's [Computer Systems Technology – Software Development and Network Engineering](https://academics.sheridancollege.ca/programs/computer-systems-technology-software-development-and-network-engineering) co-op program.

I have a passion for programming and game development.  What I enjoy the most about programming is seeing the application I am developing “come to life” as in seeing everything working together as intended.  I love to learn and I’m always interested in doing better or taking ideas from others, I have learned to learn from the mistakes I make to not repeat them in the future.  

On my free time I like to develop random applications or games.  I have developed my own [discord bot](https://github.com/MichaelDessureault/Discord-Bot) for me and my friends to use in your discord server.  I have developed a few small games with unity in C# such as [chess](https://github.com/MichaelDessureault/Chess), [tetris](https://github.com/MichaelDessureault/Tetris) and more. 

I am very easy to get along with, not a shy person, and I tend to learn quickly on most stuff.

Hobbies I have outside of development would be doing research anything space related and playing games with friends.
